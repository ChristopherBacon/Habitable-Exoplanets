# Habitable-Exoplanets
A scikit-learn ML project utilising NASA exoplanet data to determine which exoplanets are good candidates for life.

# Data

1. [Filteredexoplanets2.csv](Filteredexoplanets2.csv) NASA exoplanet data set.

# Notebook

1. [Exoplanet Data.ipynb](https://github.com/ChristopherBacon/Habitable-Exoplanets/blob/main/Exoplanet%20Data.ipynb) notebook containing analysis of the dataset.

# Conclusion

Another scikit-learn project, utlising ML models to predict hability. Another project that I learnt a lot from, this was one of my first ML projects and was great to practice on a NASA dataset. Hopefully I will be able to explore some further astro datasets in future and utilise different ML libraries.
